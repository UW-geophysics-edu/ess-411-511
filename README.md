## Course description
Continuum mechanics describes how internal and boundary forces can affect and change the interiors of bodies. Conservation laws and constitutive relations allow us to apply continuum concepts to studies of the Earth. In this class, we use Cartesian tensors to describe stress and strain, strain rate, and other continuum behaviors such as thermal response. For more details, see the Schedule page. Continuum mechanics was developed in the nineteenth century and is a fundamental underpinning of many fields of study besides the Earth Sciences. (For example, extracting a wine-bottle cork involves stress, strain, and constitutive relations.)

## Meetings
Lectures M-W-F 10:30 – 11:20 JHN 170
Problem sessions Th 1:30 – 2:50 JHN 170
Grading policy
Grades in ESS 411 will be based on homework solutions (50%), the final exam (20%), the
mid-term (20%), and class participation (10%).
In 511, grades will be based on the same items, with the addition of the term project. Weights
for the exams and participation will be the same, but homework will count for 40% and the
final project for 10% of the final grade.
ESS 511 Term project
Each 511 participant will investigate a topic involving some aspect of continuum mechanics.
Ideally it can be helpful to your research program. You will make an AGU/GSA-style 12-
minute oral presentation of your results at 8:30 on Monday morning December 13, when we
would otherwise be scheduled for a final exam (the final will be a take-home). You will also
turn in a written report in the style and length of a short paper in Geology or Geophysical
Research Letters.

We may do some occasional reading and problems from this book. The appropriate sections
will be made available as needed.
Tests
There will be a timed take-home midterm and a timed take-home final exam.
Class participation
One student will volunteer to write a one-paragraph report at the start of each class, on the key
take-away message from the previous class. The volunteer will turn in the written report and
give an oral report of 90 seconds or less, when we meet next. (The goal is not to give a
synopsis of all the developments during the class, but rather to extract just the key ideas.)
Participants are encouraged to work together on assignments and in study sessions, but each
participant should then write up his or her own answers or homework and tests in their own
words.
We encourage questions and discussions during class if points are unclear.
Disability-related Needs
To request academic accommodations due to a disability, please contact Disability
Resources for Students (DRS) 011 Mary Gates Hall
uwdrs@uw.edu
206-543-8924 (Voice), 206-543-8925 (TTY), 206-616-8379 (FAX).
If you have a letter from DRS, please present the letter to the coordinating instructor so that
he or she can discuss with you the accommodations that you might need in this class.
Academic Integrity
At the University level, passing off anyone else’s scholarly work (which can include written
material, exam answers, graphics or other images, and even ideas) as your own, without
proper attribution, is considered to be academic misconduct. For example, cutting and
pasting text from a web site and submitting it as your own work is plagiarism, and repeat
offenses can lead to dismissal from the university.
Plagiarism, cheating, and other misconduct are serious violations of the University of
Washington Student Conduct Code (WAC 478‐120).
http://www.washington.edu/cssc/for-students/student-code-of-conduct/
We expect that you will know and follow the university’s policies on cheating and plagiarism.
Any suspected cases of academic misconduct will be handled according to University of
Washington regulations. For more information, see the University of Washington
Community Standards and Student Conduct website. http://www.washington.edu/cssc/
Please also review the College of the Environment Academic Misconduct Policy.

Religious Accommodations
Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student
absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized
religious activities. The UW’s policy, including more information about how to request
an accommodation, is available at Religious Accommodations Policy
(https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/).
Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the
Religious Accommodations Request form
(https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/)
